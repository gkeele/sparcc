\title{Calculate the probability of detecting any false QTL from SPARCC genome scans output from run.sim.scans()}
\usage{
\method{pull}{false.positive.prob}(sim.scans, thresh, window.mb = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim.scans}{Output simulated genome scans from run.sim.scans().}

\item{thresh}{A list of threshold, calculated from get.gev.thresh(), that correspond to the scans in sim.scans.}

\item{window.mb}{DEFAULT: 5. Loci upstream and downstream the specified window.mb in Mb will also be checked 
for statistically significant signals. Sometimes the statistical score will not pass at the simulated QTL, but
does at nearby loci.}
}
\description{
This function takes output genome scans from run.sim.scans() and calculates the probability that any false QTL 
are detected. A window around the QTL can be specified to allow peaks not immediately at the simulated locus but likely
tagging the QTL to also be excluded
